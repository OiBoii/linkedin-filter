# Chrome Web Store Listing Draft

## Short Description

Filter LinkedIn job listings faster with precise include, exclude, company, and label rules.

## Detailed Description

inRole helps you narrow LinkedIn job listings with local, user-controlled filters.

What you can do:

- Include target role phrases (OR matching)
- Exclude role phrases
- Exclude specific companies
- Apply strict tile label rules (Early applicant, Actively reviewing, Promoted, Works/work here)
- Choose filtered display mode (Hide or Dim)
- Apply URL-based posted-time filtering

All filtering runs locally in your browser. No external analytics or data transfer.

## Permissions Justification (User-Friendly)

- Storage: saves your filter preferences.
- Active Tab + Scripting: ensures filters are applied reliably on the active LinkedIn jobs page.
- LinkedIn host access only: extension runs only where needed.

## Screenshot Checklist
